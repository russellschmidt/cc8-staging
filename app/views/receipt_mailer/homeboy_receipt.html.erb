<p>Hi <%= /^\w*\b/.match(@fullname)[0] %>,</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">
  You just invested <%= number_to_currency(@total / 100) %>  to jumpstart Homeboy Recycling’s (formerly Isidore Recycling) computer de-manufacturing near downtown L.A.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">
  What does that mean?</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;"><b>YOU ARE AWESOME! Your&nbsp;<%= number_to_currency(@gift / 100 ) %>&nbsp;is going to be pooled with funds from more than a dozen other investors to take the program to the next level in March<%= @tip > 0 ? " and help Climate Cents continue to support this project and others." : "." %></b></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">Our partners at Homeboy take apart old computers and extract valuable metals in a safe, environmentally friendly way.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><b>Recycling all the electronic waste we’d normally throw into landfills is one of the best ways to reduce toxic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling not only prevents dangerous lead and arsenic from polluting our water supplies, it also recovers valuable metals like copper, gold, and aluminum which means we don’t have to spend a massive amount of energy mining these materials from the earth’s soil. And that equals huge reductions in greenhouse gases. Recycling 12.5 tons  of computers each month recovers nearly 7 tons of useful metals, diverts 150 lbs of toxic metals, and cuts CO2 emissions by 2.2 tons.</b></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">
  <b>You personally made possible <%= @co2 %> pounds of that total.</b></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">Why does that matter?</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">Because human-generated greenhouse gases like CO2 are the cause of global warming.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">Because Homeboy Recycling’s work provides job training and employment opportunities for people exiting California’s broken correctional system who are desperately in need of a second chance and a way to become productive members of society.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><b>So YOUR support is turning the tide against CO2 and lifting up the most disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles.</b></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">Feels good, doesn't it?</p>
