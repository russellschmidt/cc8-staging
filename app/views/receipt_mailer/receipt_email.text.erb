Hi <%= /^\w*\b/.match(@fullname) %>,

You just invested <%= number_to_currency(@total / 100) %> in <%= Project.find(Campaign.find(@campaignId).project_id).name %>..

What does that mean?

YOU ARE AWESOME! Your <%= number_to_currency( @gift / 100 ) %> is going to be pooled with funds from other investors to make this campaign possible<%= @tip > 0 ? " and help Climate Cents continue to support this project and others." : "." %>

You personally made possible <%= @co2 %> pounds of CO2 removal from the atmosphere.

Why does that matter?

Because human-generated greenhouse gases like CO2 are the cause of global warming.

So YOUR support is turning the tide against CO2 and helping your local community.

Feels good, doesn't it?
