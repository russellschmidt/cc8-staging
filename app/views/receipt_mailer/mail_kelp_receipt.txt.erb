Hi <%= donation_object.donation.name %>,

You just invested <%= number_to_currency(donation_object.charge.amount / 100) %> to restore Kelp Forests in the Santa Monica Bay<%= donation_object.donation.tip_in_cents > 0 ? " and help Climate Cents continue to support this project and others." : "." %>

What does that mean?

YOU ARE AWESOME! Your <%= number_to_currency(donation_object.donation.campaign_donation_in_cents / 100 ) %> is going to be pooled with funds from more than 40 other investors to make possible Kelp Restoration Dive #5 at the end of the month.

Our partners from the Bay Foundation will clear 300 square meters of seafloor at Plot S23-NE in the Santa Monica Bay.

Giant kelp will rapidly start to grow and over the next year it'll draw down 8.5 TONS of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the climate system. You personally made possible <%= co2 %> of that total.


Why does that matter?

Because human-generated greenhouse gases like CO2 are the cause of global warming.

Because the oceans absorb more than 30% of the CO2 humans emit into the atmosphere and that makes the water more acidic, hurting all kinds of marine life.

So YOUR support is turning the tide against CO2 and restoring the "rainforests of the sea" so that thriving populations of fish, uni and all kinds of other plants and animals can return to the shores of Southern California.

Feels good, doesn't it?

Share the story of your involvement on Facebook or Twitter. You'll motivate your friends to take action and you'll look good doing it.
